       <p class="heading3-para">Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated during the Italian Renaissance
        in the fifteenth century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia.
        It has since become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary.
        Ballet has been influential globally and has defined the foundational techniques which are used 
        in many other dance genres and cultures.</p>
